Pervasive-Computing-Shared-Surface
==================================

Pervasive computing : Exchanging images on a shared surface

* Detect different cell phones placed on the surface.
* Distinctly visualize the different cell phones placed on the surface.
* Allow ‘pinning‘ the cell phone to the surface, after which it can be removed, but the visualization remains, allowing for interactions to continue.
* Build a basic Android photo browser that visualizes images on the local devices.
* Display images from the cell phone on the surface by sending it from the Andoid App over a network connection. Make sure to visually link the images on the surface to the cell phone they belong to.
* Provide rich ways in which to browse through the images visualized on the surface. (E.g. ScatterView)
* Allow transferring images between the cell phones placed on the surface by using touch gestures to drag and drop images on the visualisation of other phones.

In summary, the three main components of are:

* Surface app that shows the phones, images and touch gestures to exchange images
* Anrdoid app with image browser
* Network component to exchange data between the multiple phones and the surface
